# Cozmo Clench Robotics
Arduino IDE

A manually operated robotic system equipped with a manipulator arm is developed, capable of grasping objects of various shapes and sizes. Additionally, it is designed to navigate over obstacles while securely holding these objects. The primary objective is to optimize the system for completing the challenge with maximum efficiency, aiming to achieve the shortest possible completion time.
